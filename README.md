## Description

A travel journal app. It's basically React w/ Next.js, awesome-icons. By making this simple app I learned how to fetch data (here it's array of objects) and wrap it into reusable components. In this case data is stored locally, in /lib/data (the module exports static JSON).
This project was a part of Front-end bootcamp on Scrimba ([click here for more info about it](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend)).

Project is deployed on Vercel, you can try it [here](https://ri-travel-journal.vercel.app/).
